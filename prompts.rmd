The colours of the gender distribution plot grouped
  by experimental group are still wrong: they're
  both blue. In the debug output (in the
  overview_results notebook) you can see that indeed
  the incorrect colours are passed: blue twice
  instead of blue and red/orange/pink. I tried
  changing the order of function calls, but that
  didn't change anything. Again, only the gender plot
  shows blue twice and the others are fine, so the
  order of function calls cannot be the culprit here.
  Please look deeper into this issue and help me fix
  this mistake.
